add testing Rspec and Capybara gems to Gemfile

group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.5'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'factory_girl_rails'
end

then do:
bundle install

shoulda-matchers
shoulda-matchers make testing common Rails functionality much faster and easier.
You can write identical tests in rspec all by itself, but with shoulda-matcher these common tests are reduced to one line.
To set this up, you paste the following to your spec/rails_helper.rb file:

Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
  config.integrate do |with|
    with.test_framework :rspec
    with.library :rails
  end
end

The tests you write with shoulda-matcher get executed when you run your rspec tests.

capybara
capybara tests the totality of your applicationâ€™s functionality by simulating how a real-world agent
actually interacts with your app.
First, paste the following into your spec/rails_helper.rb file:

require 'capybara/rails'

Now, paste the following into your spec/spec_helper.rb file:

require 'capybara/rspec'


factory_girl_rails
This provides a nice way to spoof the models you create in your application.
To use it, you need to add a couple of things to your spec/spec_helper.rb file.
First, paste the following requirement:

require 'factory_girl_rails'

Then, add the following to the RSpec.configure block:

# RSpec
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # ...

  config.include FactoryGirl::Syntax::Methods
  # ...
end
